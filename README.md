# Web Reload

Web Reload is a browser extension which monitors active resources 
on a web page and reloads them as they change.

It defaults to using a socket server connection on port 35729, and will
fallback to a polling mode when no server is available.

It supports all tags, and will look search for matching urls in `href`, `src`,
`srcset` and `style` when a file change is detected.
